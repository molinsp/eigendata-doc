# üìñ Introduction

Non-technical users such as operations managers often need to process and analyze data to get insights about business processes and make decisions. This is often done in spreadsheets in a way that is time-consuming and often leads to errors. 

To overcome challenges found in spreadsheets, many have learned basic coding skills to solve business problems. But for these "semi-technical" users that primarily care about solving a problem, the cognitive overhead of remembering code syntax is too high.

**Eigendata empowers these "semi-technical" users with a Python "low-code" tool that makes manipulating data as easy as spreadsheets, without any of the limitations**. It enables users to work with data quickly without having to deal with the overhead of remembering basic python syntax, while retaining the power of code to review changes and execute the workflow in an automated way.

# üíª JupyterLab extension

**Eigendata is a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) extension** that includes

1. **Formulabar:** A low-code interface rendered below notebook cells, providing fast access to common data transformations with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (can be hidden/shown with `Ctrl + E`)
2. **Data visualizer:** Side-bar that lets you inspect the loaded dataframes

2. Instal desktop version (easy)
   1. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kJS_iR57bOgr1GDmjIOm62VLp-6zbfyL/view?usp=sharing" download="">Mac¬†Installer</a>

3. Install as a python package (advanced)
   1. If you already have Jupyter Lab >3.0, you can install it with `pip install eigendata`
   2. If you do not have Jupyter Lab installed
      1. [Download](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) & install miniconda
      2. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molinsp/eigendata-doc/master/docs/files/environment.yml" download="">Download conda environment configuration file</a>
      3. Create a new environment with all dependencies `conda env create -f eigendata-jlab3.yaml ` 

# üß© Extension framework

Eigendata is built on top of an extensible framework to render Python methods as GUIs.

To use your own custom transformations:

1. You can add the JSON code to user transformations in the settings of the eigendata extension. 
2. If you want to share transformations across a team (e.g. common features), you can also provide a transformation sever URL that serves a file with the transformations. This can be set up with the `transformationServer` and `transformationAuth` in eigendata settings.

You can learn more about the transformation UI spec and how to create your own transformations in our [transformation documentation](/Transformation_documentation.ipynb).

**Example transformation UI from a JSON definition:**

```json 
"pandas.DataFrame.drop" : {
  "form" : {
        "required" : [
          "columns"
        ],
        "definitions" : {
          "columns" : {
            "type" : "array",
            "uniqueItems" : true,
            "items" : {
              "type" : "string",
              "enum" : []
            }
          }
        },
        "properties" : {
          "columns" : {
            "$ref" : "#/definitions/columns",
            "description" : "Select the columns that you want to remove."
          }
        },
        "title" : "Drop columns",
        "description" : "Drop columns from the dataframe.",
        "type" : "object",
        "callerObject" : "DataFrame",
    		"returnType" : "DataFrame",
        "function" : "drop"
      }
}
```

And the UI rendered based on this definition:

# ‚ùìFAQ

### Magic Formula Bar is blank/does not appear

This can be due to an adblocker preventing Eigendata from loading the transformations (which are hosted on our servers). In case you are using *Adguard*, you will need to disable it to get Eigendata working. Alternatively, you can switch to a browser where you don't have an adblocker installed.
